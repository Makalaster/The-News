#### Overview

##### Team members - Will, Ivonne, Sam

Our app for this project is a news reader based on the New York Times API per the following specifications:

* [CNN](CNN)

Users can view news as it comes out based on category, and they can view top news items in a continuous stream. Users can also share articles via social media. The app periodically checks for new articles, and the user can also manually check for updates.

#### Functionality

When the app first opens, it takes the user to a loading page, which checks the server for new articles, which will be available for reading once the check is complete.
